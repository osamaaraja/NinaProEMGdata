# Amputee Data Analysis from Nina Pro Database

## Description
This repository contains amputee data sourced from the open-source [Nina Pro database](http://ninapro.hevs.ch/). The Python scripts provided in this repository perform various data processing tasks, including filtering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hudgin feature extraction, and the implementation of an autoencoder model for dimensionality reduction.

- Data Filtering: Filter the raw data to remove noise and prepare it for further analysis.
- PCA: Perform Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
- Feature Extraction: Extract Hudgin features from the data for more detailed analysis.
- Autoencoder: Use the autoencoder model to reduce dimensionality and extract meaningful representations of the data.
